Findings after evaluation.
    
F-stats and Prob(F-stats) (overall model fit) - 308.0 and 1.04e-67(approx. 0.0) - Model fir is significant and explained 90% variance is just not by chance.
R-sqaured and Adjusted R-squared (extent of fit) - 0.899 and 0.896 - 90% variance explained.
p-values - p-values for all the coefficients seem to be less than the significance level of 0.05. - meaning that all the predictors are statistically significant.
